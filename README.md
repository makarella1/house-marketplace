<h2>Little conclusion</h2>
<hr />
<strong>On the one hand, Firebase is a pretty powerful tool which may come in handy in implementing complicated features fast and (almost) without pain.
But on the other hand, it hides a lot of magic under the hood. I just copied and pasted code from the documentation very often. Well, I admit that it isn't so bad,
but I felt wrong doing it haha. Anyways, you can control that magic, when I was doing this project a huge amount of bugs appeared just because I didn't set up the project 
properly: didn't write any DB rules or my indexes were invalid etc. (that was kind of exotic doing it because you don't normally do such things). 
<br />
<br />
Talking about another new library that I've used - DaisyUI. To cut the long story short, I didn't like it. 
It's impossible to use it in combination with Tailwind and CSS modules. It pushed me to write weird code just to make it work. Frankly speaking, I feel that component
libraries are not my thing, I'll probably never use DaisyUI again. 
<br />
<br />
However, I enjoyed the process of learning new tools and consolidating my previous knowledge, the project itself was exciting.

Appreciate your time. Now it's time to move on, is Typescript waiting for me? ðŸ™‚
